>Our contribution will be a built-in enhancement of *SQLite* (SeSQLite), providing fine-grained mandatory access control (MAC) for database objects. SeSQLite will make access control decisions based on a SELinux security policy, in the same way as user access to file system objects is enriched by SELinux in the kernel.
